Data Schemas ad Python Tools for the Polybot Project

## Organization

This repository will contain a few different definitions of the data formats:

- *JSON Schema*: [Single Source of Truth] Implementation of the Schema as a JSON file
- *Pydantic*: Implementation of the data format in Pydantic to faciliate the use of data in the format

We also include a few examples of the data to test the schemas in [`examples`](./examples)
